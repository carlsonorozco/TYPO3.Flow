Security Framework
==================

All tasks related to security of a TYPO3 Flow application are handled centrally by the security
framework. Besides other functionality, this includes especially features like
authentication, authorization, channel security and a powerful policy component. This
chapter describes how you can use TYPO3 Flow's security features and how they work internally.

Activation and initialization
=============================

All the described features in this chapter can be enable or disabled by setting the
following value in *Settings.yaml* configuration file:

*Example: Enable the security features in the Settings.yaml configuration file*

.. code-block:: yaml

	Flow:
	  security:
	    enable:
		  TRUE

If set to "yes", which is the default, the security framework engages with TYPO3 Flow
by vowing in two AOP advices into the MVC dispatcher and another two into the
persistence layer classes.

Security context
----------------

The first security advice (``initializeSecurity`` in the
``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Aspect\RequestDispatchingAspect``) initializes the security context
for the current request. The security context (``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Context``) shipped
with TYPO3 Flow, lies in session scope and holds context data like the current authentication
status. That means, if you need data related to security, the security context (you can
get it easily with dependency injection) will be your main information source. The details
of the context's data will be described in the next chapters.

Authentication
==============

One of the main things people associate with security is authentication. That means to
identify your communication partner - the one sending a request to TYPO3 Flow. Therefore the
framework provides an infrastructure to easily use different mechanisms for such a
plausibility proof. The most important achievement of the provided infrastructure is its
flexible extensibility. You can easily write your own authentication mechanisms and
configure the framework to use them without touching the framework code itself. The
details are explained in the section  :ref:`Implementing your own authentication mechanism`.

.. _Using the authentication controller:

Using the authentication controller
-----------------------------------

First, let's see how you can use TYPO3 Flow's authentication features. There is a special
controller in the security package: the ``AuthenticationController``. This controller has
two actions, namely ``authenticateAction()`` and ``logoutAction()``, an appropriate route
is configured. If you call ``http://localhost/flow/authenticate`` in your Browser, the
default authentication mechanism will be triggered. This mechanism, implemented in a so
called authentication provider, authenticates a user account by checking a username and
password against accounts stored in the content repository. [#]_

The configuration for this default provider, which is shipped with TYPO3 Flow's default
configuration looks like this:

*Example: Configuration of the default username/password authentication mechanism in Settings.yaml*

.. code-block:: yaml

	Flow:
	  security:
	    authentication:
	      providers:
	        DefaultProvider:
	          provider: PersistedUsernamePasswordProvider

This registers the ``PersistedUsernamePasswordProvider`` authentication provider under
the name "``DefaultProvider``" as the only, global authentication mechanism. To
successfully authenticate an account with this default provider, you'll obviously have to
provide a username and password. This is done by sending two POST variables to the
authentication controller. Have a look at the following HTML snippet with a simple login
form you can use for that:

*Example: A simple login form*

.. code-block:: html

	<form action="flow/authenticate" method="post" name="loginform">
		<input type="text" id="username"
			name="__authentication[TYPO3][Flow][Security][Authentication][Token][UsernamePassword][username]"
			value="" tabindex="1" />
		<input type="password" id="password"
			name="__authentication[TYPO3][Flow][Security][Authentication][Token][UsernamePassword][password]"
			value="" tabindex="2" />
		<input type="submit" value="Login" tabindex="3" />
	</form>

After submitting the form, the internal authentication process will be triggered and if
you provided valid credentials an account will be authenticated afterwards. [#]_

.. note::

	After authentication the ``authenticate()`` action will automatically redirect to the
	original request, if the authentication process has been triggered due missing privileges
	while handling this original request.

Visual Overview about the authentication process

The following diagrams put the user-visible parts of the authentication process into perspective.

The internal authentication process
-----------------------------------

Now that you know, how you can authenticate, let's have a look at the internal process.
The following sequence diagram shows the participating components and their interaction:

.. figure:: Images/Security_BasicAuthenticationProcess.png
	:alt: Internal authentication process
	:class: screenshot-fullsize

	Internal authentication process

As already explained, the security framework is initialized in the dispatcher by vowing in
an AOP advice, which resides in the ``RequestDispatchingAspect`` class. This advice
intercepts the request dispatching before any controller is called. Regarding
authentication, you can see, that a so called authentication token will be stored in the
security context and some credentials will be updated in it.

Authentication tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An authentication token holds the status of a specific authentication mechanism, for
example it receives the credentials (e.g. a username and password) needed for
authentication and stores one of the following authentication states in the session. [#]_

These constants are defined in the authentication token interface
(``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Authentication\TokenInterface``) and the status can be obtained
from the ``getAuthenticationStatus()`` method of any token.

.. tip::

	If you only want to know, if authentication was successful, you can call the
	convenient method ``isAuthenticated()``.

``NO_CREDENTIALS_GIVEN``
	This is the default state. The token is not authenticated and holds no credentials,
	that could be used for authentication.
``WRONG_CREDENTIALS``
	It was tried to authenticate the token, but the credentials were wrong.
``AUTHENTICATION_SUCCESSFUL``
	The token has been successfully authenticated.
``AUTHENTICATION_NEEDED``
	This indicates, that the token received credentials, but has not been authenticated yet.

Now you might ask yourself, how a token receives its credentials. The simple answer
is: It's up to the token, to fetch them from somewhere. The default ``UsernamePassword``
token for example looks for a username and password in the two POST parameters:
``__authentication[TYPO3][Flow][Security][Authentication][Token][UsernamePassword][username]`` and
``__authentication[TYPO3][Flow][Security][Authentication][Token][UsernamePassword][password]`` (see
:ref:`Using the authentication controller`). The framework only makes sure that
``updateCredentials()`` is called on every token, then the token has to set possibly
available credentials itself, e.g. from available headers or parameters or anything else
you can provide credentials with.

Sessionless authentication tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default Flow assumes that a token which has been successfully authenticated needs
a session in order to keep being authenticated on the next HTTP request. Therefore,
whenever a user sends a ``UsernamePassword`` token for authentication, Flow will
implicitly start a session and send a session cookie.

For authentication mechanisms which don't require a session this process can be
optimized. Headers for HTTP Basic Authentication or an API key is sent on every
request, so there's no need to start a session for keeping the token. Especially
when dealing with REST services, it is not desirable to start a session.

Authentication tokens which don't require a session simply need to implement the
``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Authentication\Token\SessionlessTokenInterface`` marker
interface. If a token carries this marker, the Authentication Manager will refrain
from starting a session during authentication.


Authentication manager and provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the tokens have been initialized the original request will be processed by the
resolved controller. In our case this is the special authentication controller
(``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Authentication\Controller\AuthenticationController``)
of TYPO3 Flow, which will call the authentication manager to authenticate the tokens. In turn
the authentication manager calls all authentication providers in the configured order. A
provider implements a specific authentication mechanism and is therefore responsible for
a specific token type. E.g. the already mentioned ``PersistedUsernamePasswordProvider``
provider is able to authenticate the ``UsernamePassword`` token.

After checking the credentials, it is the responsibility of an authentication provider to
set the correct authentication status (see above) and ``Roles`` in its corresponding token.
The role implementation resides in the ``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Policy`` namespace. (see the
Policy section for details).

.. _Account management:

Account management
------------------

In the previous section you have seen, how accounts can be authenticated in TYPO3 Flow. What
was concealed so far is, how these accounts are created or what is exactly meant by the
word "account". First of all let's define what accounts are in TYPO3 Flow and how they are used
for authentication. Following the OASIS CIQ V3.0 [#]_ specification, an account used for
authentication is separated from a user or more
general a party. The advantage of this separation is the possibility of one user having
more than one account. E.g. a user could have an account for the ``UsernamePassword``
provider and one account connected to an LDAP authentication provider. Another scenario
would be to have different accounts for different parts of your TYPO3 Flow application. Read
the next section :ref:`Advanced authentication configuration` to see how this can be
accomplished.

As explained above, the account stores the credentials needed for authentication.
Obviously these credentials are provider specific and therefore every account is only
valid for a specific authentication provider. This provider - account connection is stored
in a property of the account object named ``authenticationProviderName``. Appropriate
getters and setters are provided. The provider name is configured in the *Settings.yaml*
file. If you look back to the default configuration, you'll find the name of the default
authentication provider: ``DefaultProvider``. Besides that, each account has another
property called ``credentialsSource``, which points to the place or describes the
credentials needed for this account. This could be an LDAP query string, or in case of the
``PersistedUsernamePasswordProvider`` provider, the username, password hash and salt are
stored directly in this member variable.

It is the responsibility of the authentication provider to check the given credentials
from the authentication token, find the correct account for them [#]_ and to decide about
the authentication status of this account.

.. note::

	In case of a directory service, the real authentication will probably not take place
	in the provider itself, but the provider will pass the result of the directory service
	on to the authentication token.

.. note::

	The ``DefaultProvider`` authentication provider used in the examples is not shipped
	with TYPO3 Flow, you have to configure all available authentication providers in your application.

Creating accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating an account is as easy as creating a new account object and add it to the account
repository. Look at the following example, which uses the ``TYPO3\Flow\Security\AccountFactory``
to create a simple username/password account for the DefaultProvider:

*Example: Add a new username/password account* ::

	$identifier = 'andi';
	$password = 'secret';
	$roles = array('Acme.MyPackage:Administrator');
	$authenticationProviderName = 'DefaultProvider';

	$account = $this->accountFactory->createAccountWithPassword($identifier, $password, $roles, $authenticationProviderName);
	$this->accountRepository->add($account);

The way the credentials are stored internally is completely up to the authentication provider.
The ``PersistedUsernamePasswordProvider`` uses the
``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Cryptography\HashService`` to verify the given password. In the
example above, the given plaintext password will be securely hashed by the ``HashService``.
The hashing is the main magic happening in the ``AccountFactory`` and the reason why we don't
create  the account object directly. If you want to learn more about secure password hashing
in TYPO3 Flow, you should read the section about :ref:`Cryptography` below. You can also see, that there
is an array of roles added to the account. This is used by the policy system and will be
explained in the according section below.

.. note::

	This example expects the account factory and account repository to be available in
	``$this->accountFactory`` and ``$this->accountRepository`` respectively. If you
	use this snippet in an action controller, these can be injected very easily by
	dependency injection.

.. _Advanced authentication configuration:

Advanced authentication configuration
-------------------------------------

Parallel authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you have seen all components, taking part in the authentication process, it is
time to have a look at some advance configuration possibilities. Just to remember, here is
again the configuration of the default authentication provider:

.. code-block:: yaml

	security:
	  authentication:
	    providers:
	      DefaultProvider:
	        provider: PersistedUsernamePasswordProvider

If you have a closer look at this configuration, you can see, that the word providers is
plural. That means, you have the possibility to configure more than one provider and use
them in "parallel".

.. note::

	You will have to make sure, that each provider has a unique name. In the example above
	the provider name is ``DefaultProvider``.

*Example: Configuration of two authentication providers*

.. code-block:: yaml

	security:
	  authentication:
	    providers:
	      MyLDAPProvider:
	        provider: TYPO3\MyCoolPackage\Security\Authentication\MyLDAPProvider
	        providerOptions: 'Some LDAP configuration options'
	      DefaultProvider:
	        provider: PersistedUsernamePasswordProvider

This will advice the authentication manager to first authenticate over the LDAP provider
and if that fails it will try to authenticate the default provider. So this configuration
can be seen as an authentication fallback chain, of course you can configure as many
providers as you like, but keep in mind that the order matters.

.. note::

	As you can see in the example, the LDAP provider is provided with some options. These
	are specific configuration options for each provider, have a look in the detailed
	description to know if a specific provider needs more options to be configured and
	which.

Multi-factor authentication strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is another configuration option to realize a multi-factor-authentication. It
defaults to ``oneToken``. A configurable authentication strategy of ``allTokens`` forces
the authentication manager to always authenticate all configured providers and to make
sure that every single provider returned a positive authentication status to one of its
tokens. The authentication strategy ``atLeastOneToken`` will try to authenticate as many
tokens as possible but at least one. This is helpful to realize policies with additional
security only for some resources (e.g. SSL client certificates for an admin backend).

.. code-block:: yaml

	configuration:
	  security:
	    authentication:
	      authenticationStrategy: allTokens

Reuse of tokens and providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is another configuration option for authentication providers called ``tokenClass``,
which can be specified in the provider settings. By this option you can specify which
token should be used for a provider. Remember the token is responsible for the credentials
retrieval, i.e. if you want to authenticate let's say via username and password this setting
enables to to specify where these credentials come from. So e.g. you could reuse the one
username/password provider class and specify, whether authentication credentials are sent
in a POST request or set in an HTTP Basic authentication header.

*Example: Specifying a specific token type for an authentication provider*

.. code-block:: yaml

	security:
	  authentication:
	    providers:
	      DefaultProvider:
	        provider: PersistedUsernamePasswordProvider
	        tokenClass: UsernamePasswordHttpBasic

.. _Request Patterns:

Request Patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you know about the possibility of configuring more than one authentication
provider another scenario may come to your mind. Just imagine an application with two
areas: One user area and one administration area. Both must be protected, so we need some
kind of authentication. However for the administration area we want a stronger
authentication mechanism than for the user area. Have a look at the following provider
configuration:

*Example: Using request patterns*

.. code-block:: yaml

	security:
	  authentication:
	    providers:
	      MyLDAPProvider:
	        provider: TYPO3\MyCoolPackage\Security\Authentication\MyLDAPProvider
	        providerOptions: 'Some LDAP configuration options'
	        requestPatterns:
	         controllerObjectName: TYPO3\MyApplication\AdministrationArea\.*
	      DefaultProvider:
	        provider: PersistedUsernamePasswordProvider
	        requestPatterns:
	         controllerObjectName: TYPO3\MyApplication\UserArea\.*

Look at the new configuration option ``requestPatterns``. This enables or disables an
authentication provider, depending on given patterns. The patterns will look into the
data of the current request and tell the authentication system, if they match or not.
The patterns in the example above will match, if the controller object name of the current
request (the controller to be called) matches on the given regular expression. If a
pattern does not match, the corresponding provider will be ignored in the whole
authentication process. In the above scenario this means, all controllers responsible for
the administration area will use the LDAP authentication provider, the user area
controllers will be authenticated by the default username/password provider.

.. note::

	You can use more than one pattern in the configuration. Then the provider will only be
	active, if all patterns match on the current request.

.. tip::

	There can be patterns that match on different data of the request. Just imagine an IP
	pattern, that matches on the request IP. You could, e.g. provide different
	authentication mechanisms for people coming from your internal network, than for
	requests coming from the outside.

.. tip::

	You can easily implement your own pattern. Just implement the interface
	``TYPO3\Flow\Security\RequestPatternInterface`` and configure the pattern with its
	full qualified namespace.

:title:`Available request patterns`

+----------------------+------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Request Pattern      | Match criteria         | Configuration options                    |
+======================+========================+==========================================+

|                      | name of the controller | match on the object name.                |
|                      | that has been resolved |                                          |

|                      | for the current .      |                                          |
|                      | request                | ``My\Application\AdministrationArea\.*`` |
+----------------------+------------------------+------------------------------------------+

Authentication entry points
---------------------------

One question that has not been answered so far is: what happens if the authentication
process fails? In this case the authentication manager will throw an
``AuthenticationRequired`` exception. It might not be the best idea to let this exception
settle its way up to the browser, right? Therefore we introduced a concept called
authentication entry points. These entry points catch the mentioned exception and should
redirect the user to a place where she can provide proper credentials. This could be a
login page for the username/password provider or an HTTP header for HTTP authentication. An
entry point can be configured for each authentication provider. Look at the following
example, that redirects to a login page (Using the ``WebRedirect`` entry point).

*Example: Redirect an ``AuthenticationRequired`` exception to the login page*

.. code-block:: yaml

	security:
	  authentication:
	    providers:
	      DefaultProvider:
	        provider: PersistedUsernamePasswordProvider
	        entryPoint: 'WebRedirect'
	        entryPointOptions:
	          routeValues:
	            '@package': 'Your.Package'
	            '@controller': 'Authenticate'
	            '@action': 'login'

.. note::

	Prior to TYPO3 Flow version 1.2 the option ``routeValues`` was not supported by the WebRedirect
	entry point. Instead you could provide the option ``uri`` containing a relative or absolute
	URI to redirect to. This is still possible, but we recommend to use ``routeValues`` in
	order to make your configuration more independent from the routing configuration.

.. note::

	Of course you can implement your own entry point and configure it by using its full
	qualified class name. Just make sure to implement the
	``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Authentication\EntryPointInterface`` interface.

.. tip::

	If a request has been intercepted by an ``AuthenticationRequired`` exception, this
	request will be stored in the security context. By this, the authentication process
	can resume this request afterwards. Have a look at the TYPO3 Flow authentication controller
	if you want to see this feature in action.

.. _Authentication mechanisms shipped with TYPO3 Flow:

Authentication mechanisms shipped with TYPO3 Flow
-------------------------------------------------

This section explains the details of each authentication mechanism shipped with TYPO3 Flow.
Mainly the configuration options and usage will be exposed, if you want to know more about
the entire authentication process and how the components will work together, please have a
look in the previous sections.

Simple username/password authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Provider*

The implementation of the corresponding authentication provider resides in the class
``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Authentication\Provider\PersistedUsernamePasswordProvider``.
It is able to authenticate tokens of the type
``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Authentication\Token\UsernamePassword``. It expects a credentials
array in the token which looks like that::

	array(
	  'username' => 'admin',
	  'password' => 'plaintextPassword'
	);

It will try to find an account in the ``TYPO3\Flow\Security\AccountRepository`` that has
the username value as account identifier and fetch the credentials source, which has to be
in the following format: ``HashOfThePassword,Salt``

.. tip::

	You should always use the TYPO3 Flow hash service to generate hashes! This will make sure
	that you really have secure hashes.

The provider will explode the credentials source by the "," and try to authenticate the
token by asking the TYPO3 Flow hash service to verify the hashed password against the given
plaintext password in from the token.
If you want to know more about accounts and how you can create them, look in the
corresponding section above.

*Token*

The username/password token is implemented in the class
``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Authentication\Token\UsernamePassword``. It fetches the credentials
from the HTTP POST data, look at the following program listing for details::

	$postArguments = $this->environment->getRawPostArguments();
	$username = \TYPO3\Flow\Reflection\ObjectAccess::getPropertyPath($postArguments,
	    '__authentication.TYPO3.Flow.Security.Authentication.Token.UsernamePassword.username');
	$password = \TYPO3\Flow\Reflection\ObjectAccess::getPropertyPath($postArguments,
	    '__authentication.TYPO3.Flow.Security.Authentication.Token.UsernamePassword.password');

.. note::

	The token expects a plaintext password in the POST data. That does not mean, you have
	to transfer plaintext passwords, however it is not the responsibility of the
	authentication layer to encrypt the transfer channel. Look in the section about
	:ref:`Channel security` for any details.

.. _Implementing your own authentication mechanism:

Implementing your own authentication mechanism
----------------------------------------------

One of the main goals for the authentication architecture was to provide an easily
extensible infrastructure. Now that the authentication process has been explained, you'll
here find the steps needed to implement your own authentication mechanism:

*Authentication token*

You'll have to provide an authentication token, that implements the interface
``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Authentication\TokenInterface``:

#. The most interesting method is ``updateCredentials()``. There you'll get the current
request and you'll have to make sure that credentials sent from the client will be
fetched and stored in the token.

#. Implement the remaining methods of the interface. These are  mostly getters and setters,
have a look in one of the existing  tokens (for example
``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Authentication\Token\UsernamePassword``), if you need more
information.

*Authentication provider*

After that you'll have to implement your own authentication strategy by providing a class,
that implements the interface
``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Authentication\AuthenticationProviderInterface``:

#. In the constructor you will get the name, that has been configured for the provider and
an optional options array. Basically you can decide on your own which options you need
and how the corresponding yaml configuration will look like.

#. Then there has to be a ``canAuthenticate()`` method, which gets an authentication token
and returns a boolean value whether your provider can authenticate that token or not.
Most likely you will call ``getAuthenticationProviderName()`` on the token and check,
if it matches the provider name given to you in your provider's constructor. In
addition to this, the method ``getTokenClassNames()`` has to return an array with all
authentication token classes, your provider is able to authenticate.

#. All the magic will happen in the ``authenticate()`` method, which will get an appropriate
authentication token. Basically you could do whatever you want in this method, the
only thing you'll have to make sure is to set the correct status (possible values are
defined as constants in the token interface and explained above). If authentication
succeeds you might also want to set an account in the given token, to add some roles
to the current security context. However, here is the recommended way of what should
be done in this method and if you don't have really good reasons, you shouldn't
deviate from this procedure.

#. Get the credentials provided by the client from the authentication token
   (``getCredentials()``)

#. Retrieve the corresponding account object from the account repository, which
   you should inject into your provider by dependency injection. The repository
   provides a convenient find method for this task:
   ``findActiveByAccountIdentifierAndAuthenticationProviderName()``.

#. The ``credentialsSource`` property of the account will hold the credentials
   you'll need to compare or at least the information, where these credentials lie.

#. Start the authentication process (e.g. compare credentials/call directory service/...).

#. Depending on the authentication result, set the correct status in the
   authentication token, by ``calling setAuthenticationStatus()``.

#. Set the account in the authentication token, if authentication succeeded. This
   will add the roles of this token to the security context.

Authorization
=============

This section covers the authorization features of TYPO3 Flow and how those can be leveraged in
order to configure fine grained access rights.

.. note::

	With version 2.3 of Flow the security framework was subject to a major refactoring.
	In that process the format of the policy configuration was adjusted in order to gain
	flexibility.
	Amongst others the term ``resource`` has been renamed to ``privilege`` and ACLs are
	now configured directly with the respective role.
	All changes are covered by code migrations, so make sure to run the ``./flow core:migrate``
 	command when upgrading from a previous version.

Privileges
----------------------------

In a complex web application there are different elements you might want to protect.
This could be the permission to execute certain actions or the retrieval of certain data that has been
stored in the system.
In order to distinguish between the different types the concept of ``Privilege Types`` has been introduced.
Privilege Types are responsible to protect the different parts of an application. Flow provides the two
generic types ``MethodPrivilege`` and ``EntityPrivilege``, which will be explained in detail in the sections
below.

.. _Access Control Lists:

Defining Privileges (Policies)
========================================

This section will introduce the recommended and default way of connecting authentication
with authorization. In TYPO3 Flow policies are defined in a declarative way. This is very powerful and gives
you the possibility to change the security policy of your application without touching any PHP code.
The policy system deals with two major objects, which are explained below: ``Roles`` and ``Privilege Targets``.
All policy definitions are configured in the ``Policy.yaml`` files.

*Privilege Targets*

In general a Privilege Target is the definition pointing to something you want to protect.
It consists of a **Privilege Type**, a **unique name** and a **matcher expression** defining which
things should be protected by this target.

The privilege type defines the nature of the element to protect. This could be the execution of a certain action in your system, the retrieval of objects from the database, or any other kind of action you want to supervise in your application.
The following example defines a Privilege Target for the ``MethodPrivilege`` type to protect the execution of some methods.

*Example: privilege target definition in the Policy.yaml file*

.. code-block:: yaml

     privilegeTargets:

        'TYPO3\Flow\Security\Authorization\Privilege\Method\MethodPrivilege':

          'Acme.MyPackage:RestrictedController.customerAction':
            matcher: 'method(Acme\MyPackage\Controller\RestrictedController->customerAction())'

           'Acme.MyPackage:RestrictedController.adminAction':
            matcher: 'method(Acme\MyPackage\Controller\RestrictedController->adminAction())'

          'Acme.MyPackage:editOwnPost':
            matcher: 'method(Acme\MyPackage\Controller\PostController->editAction(post.owner == current.securityContext.party))'



Privilege targets are defined in the ``Policy.yaml`` file of your package and are grouped by their respective types, which are define by the fully qualified classname of the privilege type to be used (e.g. ``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Authorization\Privilege\Method\MethodPrivilege``). Besides the type each privilege target is given a unique name [#]_ and a so called matcher expression, which would be a pointcut expression in case of the Method Privilege.

.. note:

	Practically a pointcut expression is a regular expression that matches on certain methods.
	There are more pointcut expressions you can use to describe the methods addressed by a
	specific resource, the whole syntax is described in detail in the chapter about AOP.

Looking back to the example above, there are three privilege targets defined, matching different methods, which should be protected. You even can use runtime evaluations to specify method arguments, which have to match when the method is called.


*Roles and privileges*

In the section about authentication roles have been introduced. A role are
attached to a user's security context by the authentication system, to determine which privileges should be granted to
her. I.e. the access rights of a user are decoupled from the user object itself, making it
a lot more flexible, if you want to change them. In TYPO3 Flow roles are defined in the
``Policy.yaml`` files, and are unique within your package namespace. The full identifier
for a role would be ``<PackageKey>:<RoleName>``.

For the following examples the context is the ``Policy.yaml`` file of the ``Acme.MyPackage`` package.

Following is an example of a simple policy configuration, that will proclaim the roles
``Acme.MyPackage:Administrator``, ``Acme.MyPackage:Customer``, and
``Acme.MyPackage:PrivilegedCustomer`` to the system and assign certain
privileges to them.

*Example: Simple roles definition in the Policy.yaml file*

.. code-block:: yaml

	roles:
	  âAcme.MyPackage:Administratorâ:
                 privileges: []

	  âAcme.MyPackage:Customerâ:
                 privileges: []

	  âAcme.MyPackage:PrivilegedCustomerâ:
                 parentRoles: [âAcme.MyPackage:Customerâ]
                 privileges: []

The role ``Acme.MyPackage:PrivilegedCustomer`` is configured as a sub role of
``Acme.MyPackage:Customer``, for example it will inherit the privileges from the
``Acme.MyPackage:Customer`` role.

TYPO3 Flow will always add the magic ``TYPO3.Flow:Everybody`` role, which you don't have to
configure yourself. This role will also be present, if no account is authenticated.

Likewise, the magic role ``TYPO3.Flow:Anonymous`` is added to the security context if no user
is authenticated and ``TYPO3.Flow:AuthenticatedUser`` if there is an authenticated user.

*Defining Privileges and Permissions*

The last step is to connect privilege targets with roles by assigning permissions. Let's
extends our roles definition accordingly:

*Example: Defining privileges and permissions*

.. code-block:: yaml

	roles:
	  âAcme.MyPackage:Administratorâ:
                 privileges:
                   -
                     privilegeTarget: 'Acme.MyPackage:RestrictedController.customerAction'
                     permission: GRANT
                   -
                     privilegeTarget: 'Acme.MyPackage:RestrictedController.adminAction'
                     permission: GRANT
                   -
                     privilegeTarget: 'Acme.MyPackage:RestrictedController.editOwnPost'
                     permission: GRANT

	  âAcme.MyPackage:Customerâ:
                 privileges:
                   -
                     privilegeTarget: 'Acme.MyPackage:RestrictedController.customerAction'
                     permission: GRANT

	  âAcme.MyPackage:PrivilegedCustomerâ:
                 parentRoles: [âAcme.MyPackage:Customerâ]
                 privileges:
                   -
                     privilegeTarget: 'Acme.MyPackage:RestrictedController.editOwnPost'
                     permission: GRANT


This will end up in ``Administrators`` being able to call all the methods matched by the
three privilege targets from above. However, ``Customers`` are only able to call the ``customerAction``, while ``PrivilegedCustomers`` are also allowed to edit their own posts.
And all this without touching one line of PHP code, isn't that convenient?

*Privilege evaluation*

Privilege evaluation is a really complex task, when you think carefully about it. However,
if you remember the following two rules, you will have no problems or unexpected behaviour
when writing your policies:

1. If a DENY permission is configured for one of the user's roles, access will be denied
	no matter how many grant privileges there are in other roles.

2. If no privilege has been defined for any of the user's roles, access will be denied implicitly.

This leads to the following best practice when writing policies: Use the implicit deny feature as much as possible! By defining privilege targets, all matched subjects (methods, entities, resources, etc.) will be denied implicitly. Use grant permissions to whitelist access to them for certain roles. The use of a deny permission should be the ultimate last resort for edge cases. Be careful, there is no way to override a deny, if you use it anyways!

Internal workings of method invocation authorization (MethodPrivilege)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the generic privilege types shipped with Flow is the MethodPrivilege,
which protects the invocation of certain methods. By controlling, which
methods are allowed to be called and which not, it can be globally
ensured, that no unprivileged action will be executed at any time. This
is what you would usually do, by adding an access check at the beginning
of your privileged method. In TYPO3 Flow, there is the opportunity to enforce
these checks without touching the actual method at all. Of course
TYPO3 Flow's AOP features are used to realize this completely new perspective
on authorization. If you want to learn more about AOP, please refer to
the corresponding chapter in this reference.

First, let's have a look at the following sequence diagram to get an overview of what is
happening when an authorization decision is formed and enforced:

.. figure:: Images/Security_BasicAuthorizationProcess.png
	:alt: How an authorization decision is formed and enforced in TYPO3 Flow
	:class: screenshot-fullsize

	How an authorization decision is formed and enforced in TYPO3 Flow

As already said, the whole authorization starts with an intercepted method, or in other
words with a method that should be protected and only be called by privileged users. In
the chapter about AOP you've already read, that every method interception is implemented
in a so called advice, which resides in an aspect class. Here we are: the
``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Aspect\PolicyEnforcementAspect``. Inside this aspect there is the
``enforcePolicy()`` advice, which hands over to TYPO3 Flow's authorization components.

The next thing to be called is a security interceptor. This interceptor calls the
authentication manager before it continues with the authorization process, to make sure
that the authentication status is up to date. Then the privilege manager is called,
which has to decide, if it is allowed to call the intercepted method. If not an
access denied exception is thrown by the security interceptor.

The privilege manager uses the following voting process to meet its decision:

#. Check for registered privilege types, responsible for methods (this is privileges implementing ``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Authorization\Privilege\Method\MethodPrivilegeInterface``).

#. Ask every privilege type to vote for the given method call (or join point in AOP nomenclature).

#. Count the votes and grant access, if there is at least one ``VOTE_GRANT`` vote and no
   ``VOTE_DENY`` vote. In all other cases the execution of the method will not be permitted.

*On decision voting*

As you have seen, the default way of deciding on access is done by voting. This makes the
whole authorization process very flexible and very easily extensible. You can at any time
write your own privilege classes and implement your own vote method.

If asked, each vote method has to return one of the three possibles votes: grant, deny or
abstain. There are appropriate constants defined in the privilege vote result class, which you should
use for that. You might imagine that an abstain vote has to be returned, if the privilege is not
able to give a proper grant or deny vote.

Now it could be the case that all available privileges vote to abstain. Usually the privilege
manager will then deny the privilege in question. However, you can change that behavior by configuring the
following option:

.. code-block:: yaml

	security:
	  authorization:
	    allowAccessIfAllVotersAbstain: FALSE

.. _Content security:

* HMAC is generated automatically and added as a query parameter to the form action
  URI
* Link to Property Mapping: "The Common Case: Fluid Forms"

Application firewall
--------------------

Besides the AOP powered authorization, there is another line of defense: the filter
firewall. This firewall is triggered directly when a request arrives at the MVC dispatcher.
After that the request is analyzed and can be blocked/filtered out. This adds a second
level of security right at the beginning of the whole framework run, which means
that a minimal amount of potentially insecure code will be executed before that.

.. figure:: Images/Security_FilterFirewall.png
	:alt: Blocking request with TYPO3 Flow's filter firewall
	:class: screenshot-fullsize

	Blocking request with TYPO3 Flow's filter firewall

The firewall itself is added to the MVC dispatcher by AOP, to completely decouple security
from the MVC framework and to have the possibility of disabling security. Blocking
requests with the firewall is not a big thing at all, basically a request filter object is
called, which consists of a request pattern and a security interceptor. The simple rules
is: if the pattern matches on the request, the interceptor is invoked.
:ref:`Request Patterns` are also used by the authentication components and are explained
in detail there. Talking about security interceptors: you already know the policy
enforcement interceptor, which triggers the authorization process. Here is a table of
available interceptors, shipped with TYPO3 Flow:

.. note::

	Of course you can implement your own interceptor. Just make sure to implement the
	interface: ``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Authorization\InterceptorInterface``.

:title:`TYPO3 Flow's built-in security interceptors`

+-----------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Security interceptor  | Invocation action                     |
+=======================+=======================================+
| PolicyEnforcement     | Triggers the authorization process as |
|                       | described one section above.          |
+-----------------------+---------------------------------------+
| RequireAuthentication | Calls the authentication manager to   |
|                       | authenticate all active tokens for    |
|                       | the current request.                  |
+-----------------------+---------------------------------------+

Of course you are able to configure as many request filters as
you like. Have a look at the following example to get an idea how a
firewall configuration will look like:

*Example: Firewall configuration in the Settings.yaml file*

.. code-block:: yaml

	TYPO3:
	  Flow:
	    security:
	      firewall:
	        rejectAll: FALSE

	        filters:
	          -
	            patternType:  'URI'
	            patternValue: '/some/url/.*'
	            interceptor:  'AccessGrant'
	          -
	            patternType:  'URI'
	            patternValue: '/some/url/blocked.*'
	            interceptor:  'AccessDeny'
	          -
	            patternType:  'MyCompany\MyPackage\Security\MyOwnRequestPattern'
	            patternValue: 'some pattern value'
	            interceptor:  'MyCompany\MyPackage\Security\MyOwnSecurityInterceptor'

As you can see, you can easily use your own implementations for request patterns and
security interceptors.

.. note::

	You might have noticed the ``rejectAll`` option. If this is set to ``yes``,
	only request which are explicitly allowed by a request filter will be able
	to pass the firewall.


Fluid (view) integration
========================

Now that the policy is technically enforced, these rules should also be reflected in the
view. E.g. a button or link to delete a customer should not be shown, if the user has not
the privilege to do so. If you are using the recommended Fluid templating engine, you can
simply use the security view helpers shipped with Fluid. Otherwise you would have to ask
the policy service (``TYPO3\Flow\Security\Policy\PolicyService``) for the current
privilege situation and implement the view logic on your own, however this seems not to be
the best idea one can have. Below you'll find a short description of the available Fluid
view helpers.

``ifAccess`` view helper
------------------------

This view helper implements an ifAccess/else condition, have a look at the following
example, which should be more or less self-explanatory:

*Example: the ifAccess view helper*

.. code-block:: xml

	<f:security.ifAccess privilegeTarget="somePrivilegeTargetIdentifier">
		This is being shown in case you have access to the given resource
	</f:security.ifAccess>

	<f:security.ifAccess privilegeTarget="somePrivilegeTargetIdentifier">
		<f:then>
			This is being shown in case you have access.
		</f:then>
		<f:else>
			This is being displayed in case you do not have access.
		</f:else>
	</f:security.ifAccess>

As you can imagine, the main advantage is, that the view will automatically reflect the
configured policy rules, without the need of changing any template code.

``ifHasRole`` view helper
-------------------------

This view helper is pretty similar to the ``ifAccess`` view helper, however it does not
check the access privilege for a given resource, but the availability of a certain role.
For example you could check, if the current user has the ``Administrator`` role assigned:

*Example: the ifHasRole view helper*

.. code-block:: xml

	<f:security.ifHasRole role="Administrator">
		This is being shown in case you have the Administrator role (aka role).
	</f:security.ifHasRole>

	<f:security.ifHasRole role="Administrator">
		<f:then>
			This is being shown in case you have the role.
		</f:then>
		<f:else>
			This is being displayed in case you do not have the role.
		</f:else>
	</f:security.ifHasRole>

The ``ifHasRole`` view helper will automatically add the package key from the current controller
context. This means that the examples above will only render the 'then part' if the user has the
``Administrator`` role of the package your template belongs to.
If you want to check for a role from a different package you can use the full role identifier or
specify the package key with the ``packageKey`` attribute:

*Example: check for a role from a different package*

.. code-block:: xml

	<f:security.ifHasRole role="Acme.SomeOtherPackage:Administrator">
		This is being shown in case you have the Administrator role (aka role).
	</f:security.ifHasRole>

	<f:security.ifHasRole role="Administrator" packageKey="Acme.SomeOtherPackage">
		This is being shown in case you have the Administrator role (aka role).
	</f:security.ifHasRole>
